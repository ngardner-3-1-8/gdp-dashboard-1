	\n- The first {number_solutions} solutions will be :red[based purely on EV] that is a complicated formula based on their predicted pick percentage of each team in each week, and each team's chances of winning that week.
 	\n- This will use the rankings defined above (or within our system) to determine win probability and thus pick percentage for each team.
  	\n- The remaining {number_solutions} solutions will be based on the :red[rankings and constraints you provided]. 
  	\n- This method finds the teams that are just straight up most likely to win. While helpful, thsi does not provide you with much of a competitive advantage.
   	\n- All solutions will abide by the constraints you've provided
   	\n- If you have too many constraints, or the solution is impossible, you will see an error
       	\n- :green[Mathematically, EV is most likely to win. However, using your own rankings has advantages as well, which is why we provide both solutions (Sometimes it's just preposterous to pick the Jets)]
