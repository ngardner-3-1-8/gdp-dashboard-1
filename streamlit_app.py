    \nThe biggest differences between the three contests:
    \n- DraftKings tends to be a standard contest. One pick per week for 18 weeks. A win or tie from your pick means you advance.
    \n- In Splash Sports, you will be required to make two picks per week usually starting at some point between week 11 and week 14, depending on the contest you entered. 
    \n- Circa has 20 Weeks (Christmas and Thanksgiving/Black Friday act as their own individual weeks)
    \n- Thanksgiving/Black Friday week will be Week 13 on this site (If you select Circa)
    \n- Christmas Week will be week 18 on this site (If you select Circa)
    \n- In Circa and Splash Sports, a tie eliminates you, but in Draftkings, you move on with a tie
    \n- Players in Circa and Splash Sports tend to be sharper, making it more difficult to play contrarian and ultimately win

    \nIn Splash Sports, most survivor contests have a unique requirement: You must select two teams per week in select weeks. Sometimes this is weeks where all 32 teams play, or sometimes it's the last few weeks of the season.  
    \n- However, when you start selecting two teams per week varies, depending on which contest you enter. For some, this may begin in week 11, and for others it may begin as late as week 16.
    \n- Because it varies, we want to give you the option to select which week this applies to you. Plus, it gives you more flexibility to play around with the tool.
